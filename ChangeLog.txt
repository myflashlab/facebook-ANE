  <activity
	  android:name="com.facebook.CustomTabActivity"
	  android:exported="true">
	  <intent-filter>

* The ```FB.graph.request()``` method and the ```FB.graph.version``` property is now depricated. Instead use the ```FB.graph.call()``` method and pass in the graph version directly:
```actionscript
FB.graph.addEventListener(FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE, onGraphResponse);
FB.graph.addEventListener(FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE_ERROR, onGraphError);
FB.graph.call("https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/me", URLRequestMethod.GET, new URLVariables("fields=name,email,picture&metadata=0"));

* your app must be compiled with Air SDK 22 or higher

* Updated the whitelist for facebook on iOS side of the manifest
* From FB SDK 4.6 and higher, FB is forcing Safari View Controller (SVC) instead of fast-app-switching (FAS). It seems like a pain not to have the fast-app-switching anymore but Facebook says, this is actually a good thing!

* The iOS frameworks are updated to V4.11.0 **FB_SDK_FRAMEWORKS.zip**
