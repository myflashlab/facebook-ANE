Facebook SDK Adobe Air Native Extension

*Nov 10, 2016 - V4.17.0*
* Optimized for manual permissions required by AIR SDK 24+
* Min AIR SDK 24 to compile this ANE with swf-version set to 35
* updated the core facebook SDK to V4.17.0 - Make sure to update your current [Facebook frameworks for iOS](https://github.com/myflashlab/facebook-ANE/blob/master/FB_SDK_FRAMEWORKS.zip)
* Min iOS to support this version is 8.0
* Login activity has changed to:
```xml
<activity android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity" android:configChanges="fontScale|keyboard|keyboardHidden|locale|mnc|mcc|navigation|orientation|screenLayout|screenSize|smallestScreenSize|uiMode|touchscreen" android:theme="@android:style/Theme.NoDisplay" />
```
* You no longer need to whitelist Facebook domains.
* Add Usage Description for PhotoLibrary by the Facebook SDK
```xml
<key>NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription</key>
<string>My description about why I need this feature in my app</string>
```
* Make sure to [update the common dependencies](https://github.com/myflashlab/common-dependencies-ANE): **overrideAir** and **androidSupport** to the latest version
* The ```FB.graph.request()``` method and the ```FB.graph.version``` property is now depricated. Instead use the ```FB.graph.call()``` method and pass in the graph version directly:
```actionscript
FB.graph.addEventListener(FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE, onGraphResponse);
FB.graph.addEventListener(FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE_ERROR, onGraphError);
FB.graph.call("https://graph.facebook.com/v2.8/me", URLRequestMethod.GET, new URLVariables("fields=name,email,picture&metadata=0"));
```

*May 16, 2016 - V4.11.0*
* updated the core facebook SDK to [V4.11.0](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/change-log-4.x)
* Support Android API 15 or higher
* your app must be compiled with Air SDK 22 or higher
* Added App Events support ```FB.logEvent(eventName, sum, params)```
* Using Graph API v2.6
* ```FB.logManager``` is now deprecated. you should use ```FB.auth``` instead
* Updated the whitelist for facebook on iOS side of the manifest
* From FB SDK 4.6 and higher, FB is forcing Safari View Controller (SVC) instead of fast-app-switching (FAS). It seems like a pain not to have the fast-app-switching anymore but Facebook says, this is actually a good thing! [Read here for more details](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2015/10/29/Facebook-Login-iOS9/)
* The iOS frameworks are updated to V4.11.0 **FB_SDK_FRAMEWORKS.zip**
* Added ```event.graphRequest``` to ```FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE``` and ```FBEvent.GRAPH_RESPONSE_ERROR``` so you will know what request to the graph you had sent previously
* Some minor bug fixes
